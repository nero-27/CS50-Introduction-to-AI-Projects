# Shopping
This project is part of Introduction to AI course on Edx. 
Given a dataset of a shopping website, we predict whether the user shopped or not i.e whether there was any revenue received from the user or not. 
K-Nearest Neighbour Classifier is used to predict the label class and evaluation is done using confusion matrix.
