This project is part of Edx course on Introduction to AI.
This is a project on Neural Networks. A sequential model of convolutional neural networks is generated using tensorflow and keras.
The dataset used is an image dataset that includes images of 43 different road signs. 
The model learns and classifies these images into correct road sign classes.
